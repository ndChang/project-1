# Project 1

## Task

Your task is to build a minimal version of an existing website *(with a creative spin)*

### For Project Approval

**Adobe XD mockup of the design you plan to build**
- Must include **desktop** and **mobile** view (breakpoint at 420px)
- Must be as detailed as possible and look professional
- Must reflect how you plan to implement the "creative spin"
- Must include all pages you plan to build
- Use https://loremipsum.io/generator (do not use real website's assets or text)
- When designing your XD mockup, don't forget the project requirements listed below

### Requirements

- Must be deployed on either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or [Surge](https://surge.sh/)
- Must use flexbox
- Must include a minimum of 2 event handlers
- Must include a minimum of 2 css animations
- Must look like your XD mockup (or better)
- Use https://loremipsum.io/generator (do not use real website's assets or text)
- Use a [color generator](https://mycolor.space) for your colors

### Tips

- Deploy early (day one or two) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Use high resolution images (do not adjust height, only width if you want to resize)
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase to employers)
- Every day walk around GA for 10min and approach a few members of our community asking if they have 5min to give you feedback on your website
- During this project week get feedback from one UX student on your website
- Research what you consider the best websites out there to get ideas/inspiration
